# Melody

 - Pitched sounds arranged in musical time.
 - Consist of **melodic motion**, which describes spacing of notes. Spaces are called **interval**.
 - Melodies are made up of:
 	- Steps: notes right beside each other on piano
	- Leaps: jumps greater than a step
	- Repeated notes
 - Lots of leaps can make a song vocally difficult
 - Often melody is broken into **phrases** to allow breath for singing
 - **Cadence** is the ending tone of a phrase
 
## Melodic Sequence

A pattern repeats at a different pitch level. 

## Ostinato

A musical idea that keeps repeating when other elements change.

### Bass Ostinato

Bass is where Ostinato most often occurs. Useful to ground the song. Example is repeating base line while melody changes.

### Rhythmic Ostinato

Another type of Ostinato, consisting of rhythmic repetition.

### Melodic Ostinato

Essentially a lack of harmony movement. No harmonic changes. Results in a standing still effect on the music.

## Plainsong

Pure melody, sung with no accompaniment. Sometimes known as chant or plainchant. 

### Monophony

Only one musical line at a time, no overlap with other instruments or vocalists. 

### Rhythm 

Follows a defined rhythm with no movement.

### Modes

Based upon strict melodic modes. Lack tension that propels music forward. 

## Franz Schubert

Gifted composer who rote over 600 **lied** (short German songs). Lived at the time of Beethoven (early 19th century). 

## Felix Mendlessohn 

German composer, lived in the **Romantic Period** a few decades after Schubert. Piano music features melody and accompaniment (right and left hands). 

## Themes

Bach, Mozart, and Beethoven wrote motivic music. A **motive** or **theme** is a melodic idea. It can be repeated in various ways to create different music. 

## Non-European Music

Indian music lacked harmony, and was based purely on melody, rhythm and structure. Melody referred to as rag or raga. A single work could be an hour long and be based on one rag. 

## Modernism

 - Large intervals hard to sing or even perform on instruments
 - Extreme dynamics between non-singable notes
 - Non-corporeal rhythms: not hinging on an underlying pulse
 - Short melodic phrases

## Expressionism 

 - Short disjointed phrases
 - Large skips in melody
